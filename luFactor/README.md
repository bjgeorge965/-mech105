[L,U,P] = luFactor(A)

luFactor determines the lower and upper triangular matrix of a given
system of equations or matrix.
 
Inputs: A - Cooeficient Matrix

Outputs: L - Lower Triangular Matrix
         U - Upper Triangular Matrix
         P - Pivot Matrix (keeps track of the pivots used in the LU
         decomposition)
