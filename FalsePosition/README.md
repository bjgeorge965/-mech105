%The falsePosition function uses the false position bracketing method
%to estimate the roots of a user inputted function. 
%
%   The user-input function must already be defined.
%   
%   The user will input a function and bounds as starting points for the
%   algorithm. Optional inputs 'es' and 'maxiter' will estimate the root of
%   the function to a certain percent of the true value or will run until
%   the maximum number of iterations has been reached.
